The CSS code is using a vendor prefix that is no longer necessary or supported by modern browsers. For example, using `-webkit-`, `-moz-`, or `-ms-` prefixes for properties that have standard implementations.  This can lead to inconsistent styling across different browsers and can make the CSS less maintainable.
