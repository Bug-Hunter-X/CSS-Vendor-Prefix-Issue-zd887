This repository demonstrates a common CSS bug involving unnecessary vendor prefixes and provides a solution to fix it. The `bug.css` file contains the buggy code with outdated prefixes, while `bugSolution.css` offers the corrected version.  The issue stems from using prefixes that are no longer needed, causing inconsistent rendering in different browsers. The solution involves removing these prefixes, ensuring consistent styling across all modern browsers.
